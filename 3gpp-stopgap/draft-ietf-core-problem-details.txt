                 Concise Problem Details For CoAP APIs
                 draft-ietf-core-problem-details-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-
   readable details of errors in a REST response to avoid the need to
   define new error response formats for REST APIs.  The format is
   inspired by, but intended to be more concise than, the Problem
   Details for HTTP APIs defined in RFC 7807.

1.  Introduction

   REST response status information such as CoAP [RFC7252] response
   codes is sometimes not sufficient to convey enough information about
   an error to be helpful.  This specification defines a simple and
   extensible framework to define CBOR tags to suit this purpose.  It is
   designed to be reused by REST APIs, which can identify distinct
   "problem types" specific to their needs.  Thus, API clients can be
   informed of both the high-level error class (using the response code)
   and the finer-grained details of the problem (using this vocabulary),
   as shown in Figure 1.

   The framework presented is largely inspired by the Problem Details
   for HTTP APIs defined in [RFC7807].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Basic Problem Details

   A Concise Problem Details data item is a CBOR data item with the
   following structure (notated in CDDL [RFC8610], using 65535 in place
   of a tag number to be defined for the type of problem details):

   problem-details = #6.65535(problem-details-map)
   problem-details-map = non-empty<{
     ? &(title: -1) => text
     ? &(detail: -2) => text
     ? &(instance: -3) => ~uri
     standard-problem-detail-entries
     custom-problem-detail-entries
   }>
   standard-problem-detail-entries = (
     * nint => any
   )
   custom-problem-detail-entries = (
     * (uint/detail-label) => any
   )
   detail-label = text .regexp "[^:]+" / ~uri
   non-empty<M> = (M) .and ({ + any => any })

                     Figure 2: Problem Detail Data Item

   Due to a limitation of the CDDL notation for tags, the problem type
   cannot be expressed under this name in CDDL.  It is represented in
   the tag number, which is shown here as 65535.

   One tag has been registered as a generic problem type by this
   specification (see Section 5.1).  Further problem types can be
   defined by registering additional tags (see Section 3).

   A number of problem detail entries, the Standard Problem Detail
   entries, are predefined (more predefined details can be registered,
   see Section 3.3):

   The title (key -1):
      A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.  It SHOULD
      NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem.

   The detail (key -2):
      A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the
      problem.

   The instance (key -3):
      A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the
      problem.  It may or may not yield further information if
      dereferenced.

   Consumers MUST use the type (tag number) as primary identifiers for
   the problem type; the "title" string is advisory and included only
   for consumers who are not aware of the semantics of the CBOR tag
   number used to indicate the specific problem type.

   The "detail" member, if present, ought to focus on helping the client
   correct the problem, rather than giving debugging information.
   Consumers SHOULD NOT parse the "detail" member for information;
   extensions (see Section 3) are more suitable and less error-prone
   ways to obtain such information.

   Note that the "instance" URI reference may be relative; this means
   that it must be resolved relative to the document's base URI, as per
   [STD66].

   Note that the response code information that may be available
   together with a problem report is _not_ replicated into a problem
   detail entry; compare this with "status" in [RFC7807].

      |  (*Issue*: Do we still want to define a SPDK for status, so
      |  implementations can easily stash away the response code
      |  available from context into the problem details?)

3.  Additional Problem Details

   This specification defines a single problem type, the Generic Problem
   Details problem type (represented by CBOR tag TBD400, Section 5.1).

3.1.  Additional Problem Types

   To establish a new problem type, different from the Generic Problem
   Details problem type, a CBOR Tag number needs to be registered in the
   CBOR Tags of [IANA.cbor-tags].  Note that this registry allows the
   registration of new tags under the First Come First Served policy
   [RFC8126], making new registrations available in a simple interaction
   (e.g., via web or email) with IANA, after having filled in the small
   template provided in Section 9.2 of [STD94].  Such a registration
   SHOULD provide a documentation reference and also SHOULD reference
   the present specification.

3.2.  Custom Problem Detail Entries

   Problem type definitions MAY extend the Problem Details document with
   additional entries to convey additional, problem-type-specific
   information, _custom problem details_. In the definition of a problem
   type, each custom problem detail receives a map key specific to this
   problem type (custom problem detail entry map key, unsigned integer
   or text); this SHOULD be described in the documentation that goes
   along with the registration of a CBOR Tag for the problem type.

   For text detail-labels, a name without an embedded colon can be
   chosen instead of an integer custom label, or a detail-label that is
   a URI.  This URI is for identification purposes only and MUST NOT be
   dereferenced in the normal course of handling problem details (i.e.,
   outside diagnostic/debugging procedures involving humans).

   In summary, the keys for Custom Problem Detail entries are in a
   namespace specific to the Problem Type the documentation of which
   defines these entries.  Consumers of a Problem Type instance MUST
   ignore any Custom Problem Detail entries that they do not recognize;
   this allows problem types to evolve and include additional
   information in the future.  If, in the evolution of a problem type, a
   new problem detail is added that needs to be understood by all
   consumers, a new problem type needs to be defined (i.e., problem
   detail entries are always elective, never critical, in the
   terminology of Section 5.4.1 of [RFC7252]).

3.3.  Standard Problem Detail Entries

   Beyond the Standard Problem Detail keys defined in Figure 2,
   additional Standard Problem Detail keys can be registered (see
   Section 5.2).  Standard Problem Detail keys are not specific to a
   particular problem type; they are intended to be used for problem
   details that cover an area of application that includes multiple
   registered problem types.

   Standard Problem Detail keys are negative integers, so they never can
   conflict with Custom Problem Detail keys defined for a problem type
   (which are unsigned integers or text strings).

   In summary, the keys for Standard Problem Detail entries are in a
   global namespace that applies to all Problem Types.  The
   documentation of a Problem Type MAY provide additional guidance on
   how a Standard Problem Detail entry applies to this Problem Type, but
   cannot redefine its generic semantics.

   Therefore, clients consuming problem details may be able to consume
   unknown Problem types (i.e., with unknown CBOR Tag numbers), if the
   general context (e.g., a media type known from the context such as
   that defined in Section 5.3) indicates that the present specification
   is used.  Such consumers MUST ignore any Standard Problem Detail
   entries that they do not recognize (which, for an unknown tag, by
   definition also applies to all Custom Problem Details entries).

4.  Security Considerations

   The security and privacy considerations outlined in Section 5 of
   [RFC7807] apply in full.

5.  IANA Considerations


   // RFC Editor: please replace RFC XXXX with this RFC number and
   // remove this note.

5.1.  CBOR Tag

   As per [STD94], IANA has created a "CBOR Tags" registry
   [IANA.cbor-tags], which serves as the registry for problem details
   types (see Section 3).  For use as a predefined, generic problem
   details type, IANA is requested to allocate the tag defined in
   Table 1.

   +========+===========+=========================+===========+
   | Tag    | Data Item | Semantics               | Reference |
   +========+===========+=========================+===========+
   | TBD400 | map       | Generic Problem Details | RFCXXXX   |
   +--------+-----------+-------------------------+-----------+

               Table 1: Generic Problem Details tag

5.2.  Standard Problem Detail Key registry

   This specification defines a new sub-registry for Standard Problem
   Detail Keys in the CoRE Parameters registry [IANA.core-parameters],
   with the policy "specification required" [RFC8126].

   Each entry in the registry must include:

   key value:
      a negative integer to be used as the value of the key

   name:
      a name that could be used in implementations for the key

   type:
      type of the data associated with the key; preferably in CDDL
      notation

   brief description:
      a brief description

   reference:
      a reference document

   Initial entries in this sub-registry are as follows:

   +=======+==========+======+=============================+===========+
